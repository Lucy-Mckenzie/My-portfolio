Hi everyone, I'm Lucy. And I had the role of the Scrum Facilitator along with Oliver.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:16.000
The task of the Scrum Facilitator is to create systems and processes to make sure that everyone is heard and that theyâ€™re not coming into any roadblocks.

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:28.000
Early on, we created a stress management profile and a conflict resolution plan. Because being in a team of seven, conflicts were sure to arise.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.000
To make sure everyone was on track and heard, we held daily standups.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:46.000
The standups consisted of a round-the-table question format where everyone got a chance to answer three fundamental questions.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:57.000
The first being, "What have you been doing?", "Did you come across any roadblocks?", and "What are you doing next?"

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:10.000
And this was a great way to make sure everyone was included. The structure worked really well, especially for a team of our size. Thanks to the team for always showing up on time!
