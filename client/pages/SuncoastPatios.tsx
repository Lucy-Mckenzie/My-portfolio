      Growing up, hiking was a significant part of my life, making this project especially meaningful to me. Too often, I&apos;ve encountered hikers unprepared for the trailsâ€”unaware of crucial details like distances, weather conditions, or hut closures. 
        <br/>
      &quot;We Hike&quot; is designed to address these challenges. The platform allows users to sign in, save their favorite hikes, check real-time weather for specific areas, and stay updated on trail conditions.

        DESIGN BRIEF
        </h1>
        <p className='font-manrope'>
          Suncoast Patios needed a website revamp. The outdated design was being left behind in the digital graveyard, gradually slipping down the search engine rankings.
        </p>
        <p className='pt-4 font-manrope'>
          The new design focused on SEO optimisation, user-friendly interface design, and improved usability to better serve their audience.

        Previously most of the cliental for this company was coming through word of mouth, the enquirys coming through online were next to none. 
        This was due to a few reasons, the website was getting out of date. This affected the SEO, making the website return 9th on the list of outdoor brands in Hawkes Bay.
