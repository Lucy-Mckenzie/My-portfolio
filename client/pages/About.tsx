            I&apos;m Lucy, a Software Developer based in New Zealand. I enjoy a balanced life, the fine dance between creativity and logic. This means listening to classical music while my mind works double-time crafting clean, organised code.

          MY PHILOSOPHY
        </h2>
        <p className='font-manrope pb-6'>
        <strong>I believe that values play a crucial role when selecting a new team member.</strong>
        Growing up in a big family, I learned the importance of communication, honesty, and trust. Alongside these values, one of my greatest strengths is my growth mindset. I&apos;ve always been naturally driven and deeply interested in the foundational concepts of neuroscienceâ€”<strong>where mindset is everything.</strong>
        To quote Seneca, &quot;The mind is the universe.&quot; I truly believe that the more patterns and connections you create, the broader your perception and understanding of the world becomes.

            MY JOURNEY
          </h2>
          <p className='font-manrope pb-6'>
          I grew up playing Nancy Drew games, board games, and any mystery adventure book I could get my hands on. <strong>I love the unknown</strong>, the mysteries of the universe that we may never unravel. 
          </p>
          <p className='font-manrope pb-6'>
          Programming brings a thrill, something I can&apos;t quite put my finger on. All I know is that I found coding and everything clicked into place. Studying at Dev Academy only confirmed my drive for solving problems, innovation, and my place in the developing world.

            AS A COLLEAGUE
            </h2>
            <p className='font-manrope pb-4'> 
            <strong>Collaboration is at the heart of who I am.</strong> With a background in sales, management, and tourism, I excel at bridging the gap between technical and creative minds on any team. Encouraging and working successfully with others comes naturally to me.
            </p>
             <p className='pb-4 font-manrope'>
              With extensive customer service and sales experience, my communication skills are top-notch, allowing me to work seamlessly alongside others. I have a strong sense of empathy, which helps me understand where others are coming from. My leadership in these collaborations has been one of the highlights of my career.
              I&apos;m always up for team board games or a coffee chat. I believe team collaboration is one of the key foundations of a successful company.
